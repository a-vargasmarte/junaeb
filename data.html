                    This project (i.e. Dashboard) relies mainly on administrative data from the Chilean 
                    National Board of School Aid (JUNAEB). Their large network of collaborators that allow
                    for data collection at the invididual level for thousands of schools across the country. 
                    JUNAEB manages programs and services covering all educational levels from pre-school to college. 
                    The range of programs includes: medical and dental services, nutrition, stimulation and mental 
                    health, scholarships, transport, housing and school supplies. You can see more of the 
                    invaluable work they do <a

              Every year, JUNAEB requires the assistance of all schools participating in the SMP to collect a census of
               anthropometric measurements and household surveys. The anthropometric information is officially 
               known as the Nutritional Map. Data is collected for all children attending public and subsidized schools in Pre-Kindergarten,
               Kindergarten, 1st Grade, 5th Grade and Grade 9 (high school). In 2015, 742,489 children had both instruments applied, this is 90% of all 
               students attending public or private subsidised schools. Measuring is conducted by the class professor 
               (or the professor designated by the school) through direct measurement of children's weight and height, 
               as well as presence of cavities. While there is significant variation in the methods and instruments used 
               for the measurements, the distribution of data is consistent across sub-populations and over time.

              The survey contains rich information at the household level to characterize vulnerability along with several 
              dimensions of child's health and development. The instrument presents some differences between each educational level. 
              The common information is: household composition and interactions with index child, geographic location and cultural 
              background, educational attainment and occupation of caregivers, physical resources for learning/development, 
              children's health status and educational attainment. Also in all years there are questions regarding birth and breastfeeding frequency. 
              There are two sections that are different between pre-school and the school years. The first one relates to paternal time investments 
              (only available in pre-school) and the second one relates to social and emotional aspects the child 
              (only available in school grades, with slight variation across grades).
