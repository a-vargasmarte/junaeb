            <p>The dynamics of child development has been increasingly a subject of study among researches in a wide range of disciplines. 
              A simple theoretical framework is based on the idea of fixed, discrete set of skills (e.g. cognition, socioemotional, prysical health, nutrition) 
              which evolve over time based on an unknown accumulation process (i.e. techonology). Similarly, we can describe the parental decisions regarging 
              child invesments as a function of child characteristics, household constrains and prices (e.g. alternative cost of time). In both cases we need to allow
              for shocks, i.e. unexpected events that can alter parental decisions but also the capacity of children to accumulate skills (e.g. natural disasters). 
              If we divide the skills between nutritional status and other capacities, we can think about this model graphically as:

            </p>
            <p>
             Ultimately, in onder to characterize, describe and predict skills,
              we are interested in two key steps. First, is important to measure different 
              skills and parental investments through simple but information-rich indexes, in order 
              to avoid dealing with too many moving pieces. Secondly, given a set of skills available, 
              we would like to describe the evolution of skills across individuals and communities, 
              in order to inform stakeholders as well as target, monitor and evaluate programs. While the 
              second step is the <b>Dashboard</b>, the first step is decribed below and in our documentation (found in
              our Github repository).
