            <p>
              Increasingly, highly demanded jobs require a diverse set of human
              capital skills: team-building, mindfulness, continous learning
              (see an example from
              <a
                href="https://careers.un.org/lbw/attachments/competencies_booklet_en.pdf"
                target="_blank"
                >United Nations</a
              >). Moreover, jobs in demand are linked to fast growing higher
              education programs, which in turn have stricter entry
              requirements, measured by standarized tests (like SAT or
              equivalent).
            </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example from Chile, showing the relationship between mean
            standarized college entry scores in Chile (PSU) and enrollement size
            for each program across all areas of higher education between 2006
            and 2019 (excludes programs without test requirements). Programs
            with larger enrollment also have higher admision standards,
            particularly for STEM, Business and Law.

            This complex mix of capacities, required to be successful in
            atractive career paths, demand an active human skill accumulation
            process during the school years. Extensive evidence indicates that
            active learning at school requires a mix of socio-emotional skills
            and physical health. The
            <a

              >OCDE</a

            estimates suggest that normal weight children are 13% more likely to
            perform well at school, relative to their less healthy peers.
            Moreover, both physical health and socio-emotional skills are
            intimately connected.
            <a
              href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/692016?journalCode=jhc"

            shows that obese children tend to accumulate less socio-emotional
            skills over time.

            Again, an example from Chile can be informative. Here is a binned
            plot showing the obesity prevalence at high school level by average
            school learning performace in 2015-2017 for voucher schools (each
            observation in the data is a school). School performance is measured
            by the average standarized scores (0-100) across all disciplines
            (e.g. math, languague) and school levels (primary, middle, high).
            Overall, voucher schools with high effectiveness (i.e. higher
            average learning) also have a lower proportion of obese students.

            We face a vicious cycle: stressful environments favor weight gain
            among children, which in turn affects their socio-emotional
            development, making them less likely to adopt healthy behaviors.

            <h3 class="text-primary">Monitoring early human capital skills</h3>
            <p>
              Given the importance of early human capital accumulation from a
              life-cycle perspective, we would want to track and support
              disadvantage groups once they enter the school system.
              Fortunately, there are several ways to collect information once
              children are at school. For example, in many countries the School
              Meal Programs provide an unique opportunity to collect health and
              socio-economic information of each student.
            </p>
          <p>
            Our solution is founded on exploiting the potential of such routine
            administrative data at the PK-12 ages. For example, data is
            periodically collected for all students in specific grades attending
            public and voucher schools in Chile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The toolkit is based on a simple human capital framework that
            formalize the statistical assumptions needed for a country-wide
            model that allows to predict the future path for children's human
            capital accumulation, based on the longitudinal data available from
            multiple cohorts. Our solution not only can forecast future risks at
            the local level (e.g. district), but also allow to predict and
            evaluate the impact of interventions. The toolkit is based on a
            combination of theoretical premises as well as statistical
            foundations, using simple Python tools. Below there are a few simple
            examples of functionality based on simulated data from Chile,
            representing 10% of total enrollment in 1st grade of primary school.
